Luatri is a scene management tool for Roblox. It is largely intended to be a free and open-source alternative to other similar tools on the Roblox market.

With Luatri, you can expect to see:

- Interior culling
- Particle culling
- Tree impostors
- Distance fading
- Support for 4-stage LODs
- With its own complementary runtime UI called DevTools
- And its own unobtrusive console log window
- With customizable toggle/momentary buttons
