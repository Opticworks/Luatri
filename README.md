# Opticworks VisTools

Opticworks VisTools is a scene management tool for Roblox. It is largely intended to be a free and open-source alternative to other similar tools on the Roblox market.

With our VisTools, you can expect to see:

- Interior culling
- Particle culling
- Tree impostors
- Distance fading
- Custom LOD support
- With its own complementary runtime UI called DevTools
- And its own unobtrusive console log window
- With customizable toggle/momentary buttons

Our VisTools is currently very early in the rewriting process but we should see the 0.1.0 package be ready and out by late November :)

## Ok I don't care, where's the docs?
